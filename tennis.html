        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <h3>Origins of the modern game</h3>
        <p>
          Between 1859 and 1865 Harry Gem, a solicitor, and his friend Augurio
          Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the
          Basque ball game pelota, which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in
          Birmingham, England. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they
          founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, Leamington Spa.
          This is where "lawn tennis" was used as the name of an activity by a
          club for the first time. In Tennis: A Cultural History, Heiner
          Gillmeister reveals that on 8 December 1874, British army officer
          Walter Clopton Wingfield wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he
          (Wingfield) had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis
          "for a year and a half". In December 1873, Wingfield designed and
          patented a game which he called sphairistikè (Greek: σφαιριστική,
          meaning "ball-playing"), and which was soon known simply as "sticky" –
          for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate
          of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, Wales. According to R. D. C. Evans,
          turfgrass agronomist, "Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield]
          deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis."
          According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield
          "popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which
          included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game – and most
          importantly you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing
          and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections
          with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent
          thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874." The world's
          oldest annual tennis tournament took place at Leamington Lawn Tennis
          Club in Birmingham in 1874. This was three years before the All
          England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club would hold its first
          championships at Wimbledon, in 1877. The first Championships
          culminated in a significant debate on how to standardise the rules.

          In 1913, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), now the
          International Tennis Federation (ITF), was founded and established
          three official tournaments as the major championships of the day. The
          World Grass Court Championships were awarded to Great Britain. The
          World Hard Court Championships were awarded to France; the term "hard
          court" was used for clay courts at the time. Some tournaments were
          held in Belgium instead. And the World Covered Court Championships for
          indoor courts were awarded annually; Sweden, France, Great Britain,
          Denmark, Switzerland and Spain each hosted the tournament.
