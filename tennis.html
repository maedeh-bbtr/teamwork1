        Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a
        single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each
        (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to
        strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and
        into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the
        ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.
        The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a
        point, while the opposite player will.
