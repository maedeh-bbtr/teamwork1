        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <h3>Origins of the modern game</h3>
        <p>
          Between 1859 and 1865 Harry Gem, a solicitor, and his friend Augurio
          Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the
          Basque ball game pelota, which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in
          Birmingham, England. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they
          founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, Leamington Spa.
          This is where "lawn tennis" was used as the name of an activity by a
          club for the first time. In Tennis: A Cultural History, Heiner
          Gillmeister reveals that on 8 December 1874, British army officer
          Walter Clopton Wingfield wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he
          (Wingfield) had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis
          "for a year and a half". In December 1873, Wingfield designed and
          patented a game which he called sphairistikè (Greek: σφαιριστική,
          meaning "ball-playing"), and which was soon known simply as "sticky" –
          for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate
          of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, Wales. According to R. D. C. Evans,
          turfgrass agronomist, "Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield]
          deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis."
          According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield
          "popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which
          included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game – and most
          importantly you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing
          and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections
          with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent
          thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874." The world's
          oldest annual tennis tournament took place at Leamington Lawn Tennis
          Club in Birmingham in 1874. This was three years before the All
          England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club would hold its first
          championships at Wimbledon, in 1877. The first Championships
          culminated in a significant debate on how to standardise the rules.

        <p>
          In 1913, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), now the
          International Tennis Federation (ITF), was founded and established
          three official tournaments as the major championships of the day. The
          World Grass Court Championships were awarded to Great Britain. The
          World Hard Court Championships were awarded to France; the term "hard
          court" was used for clay courts at the time. Some tournaments were
          held in Belgium instead. And the World Covered Court Championships for
          indoor courts were awarded annually; Sweden, France, Great Britain,
          Denmark, Switzerland and Spain each hosted the tournament.

        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rackets
            <p>
              The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the
              grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame
              that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100
              years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of
              standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood
              construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of
              the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon
              graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were
              introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of
              oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile,
              technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel
              of gut yet with added durability.
            </p>

          <li>
            Strings
            <p>
              here are multiple types of tennis strings, including natural gut
              and synthetic stings made from materials such as nylon, kevlar, or
              polyester.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Balls
            <p>
              Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched
              together with thread and stuffed with feathers.[63] Modern tennis
              balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating.
              Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed
              to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow
              for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain
              criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce to be approved
              for regulation play.

            Court
            <p>
              Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78
              feet (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.2 m) wide for singles matches
              and 36 ft (11 m) for doubles matches.[67] Additional clear space
              around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun
              balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court,
              parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends.

          <li>
            Lines
            <p>
              The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the
              baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the
              court). The short mark in the centre of each baseline is referred
              to as either the hash mark or the centre mark. The outermost lines
              that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines; they are
              the boundaries for doubles matches. The lines to the inside of the
              doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines, and are the
              boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline
              and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley,
              playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the centre of
              a player's side of the court is called the service line because
              the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line
              and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not
              where a player legally stands when making a serve. The line
              dividing the service line in two is called the centre line or
              centre service line. The boxes this centre line creates are called
              the service boxes; depending on a player's position, they have to
              hit the ball into one of these when serving. A ball is out only if
              none of it has hit the area inside the lines, or the line, upon
              its first bounce. All lines are required to be between 1 and 2
              inches (25 and 51 mm) in width, with the exception of the baseline
              which can be up to 4 inches (100 mm) wide, although in practice it
              is often the same width as the others.

        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <li>
          Game
          <p>
            A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player
            serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four
            points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. The
            running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to
            tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "love",
            "15", "30", and "40", respectively. If at least three points have
            been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal at 40
            apiece, the score is not called out as "40–40", but rather as
            "deuce". If at least three points have been scored by each side and
            a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game
            is "advantage" for the player in the lead.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Set
          <p>
            A set consists of a sequence of games played with service
            alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets
            certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least
            six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one
            player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game
            is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the
            set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6–6) a
            tiebreak is played. A tiebreak, played under a separate set of
            rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to
            give a final set score of 7–6. A tiebreak game can be won by scoring
            at least seven points and at least two points more than the
            opponent. In a tiebreak, two players serve by 'ABBA' system which
            has been proven to be fair. If a tiebreak is not played, the set is
            referred to as an advantage set, where the set continues without
            limit until one player leadsby a two-game margin. A "love set" means
            that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a "jam
            donut" in the US. In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the
            winner of the set and the overall score. The final score in sets is
            always read with the winning player's score first, e.g. "6–2, 4–6,
            6–0, 7–5".
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Match
          <p>
            A match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined
            through a best of three or five sets system. On the professional
            circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam
            tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and
            best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play
            best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. The first player to
            win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five,
            wins the match.[76] Only in the final sets of matches at the Olympic
            Games and Fed Cup are tiebreaks not played. In these cases, sets are
            played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead,
            occasionally leading to some remarkably long matches. In tournament
            play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the
            well-known phrase "Game, set, match" followed by the winning
            person's or team's name.
